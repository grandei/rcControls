1. Make sure all modules are pre-installed (pygame, opencv-python, djitellopy, numpy)
       + If modules are missing, use the pip commands:
          Windows: pip install
          Mac: pip3 install
2. Make sure you look through the comments of the programming files (2 total files) and adjust/complete the code
3. Make sure all other tabs are closed when running the main program: keypress_module.py
4. 2 windows should appear when running the main program: 
       + a small black box window and the video feed of your drone
       + place the two windows side by side
       + make sure the small black box window is the active window before trying to use your keyboard to control the drone
